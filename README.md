Welcome to RSL Clothing

I have created this E-commerce clothes shop using technologies such as:

JavaScript, React, Redux, Redux-Saga, React Hooks, Express.js, Node.js, 
Material UI, HTML5, CSS3, Firebase, SCSS, Styled-Components, Git

- JavaScript as the base developement language.
- Server was built using Nodejs and Express.
- Database was set using Firebase/ Firestore.
- Redux used for state managemnet.
- Stripe API used for payments.
- SCSS used for styling the components.
- Styled Components used in some components to style the application.
- React Hooks used in the front-end to avoid using stateful components.
- Jest used for Unit Testing.
- Heroku was used to deploy the application.
